Can placebos help? Does sound have the power to process complex emotions? Can music give you what you need? Is this even music?

Erin Gee, Julia E Dyck, and Viv Li offer everyday people customized positive messages, audio creations, healing frequencies, binaural beats, and ASMR, responding to the needs of our community through a practice of radical sonic care. We promise our fullest intention

The project was created using React.jquestionnaires, JavaScript ES6, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.

A fun, interactive questionnaire with popup links and play-on-click audio files encourages users to reflect on their relationship with sound and they are presented with an original "Audio Placebo" based on their answers. When users create an account they can save their Placebos and favourite sounds to return to any time!
