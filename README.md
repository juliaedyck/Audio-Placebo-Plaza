### Can placebos help?
### Does sound have the power to process complex emotions? Can music give you what you need? Is this even music?

### Erin Gee, Julia E Dyck, and Viv Li offer everyday people customized positive messages, audio creations, healing frequencies, binaural beats, and ASMR, responding to the needs of our community through a practice of radical sonic care. We promise our fullest intention
