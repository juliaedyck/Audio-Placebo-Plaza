#### Can placebos help?
#### Does sound have the power to process complex emotions? Can music give you what you need? Is this even music?

#### Erin Gee, Julia E Dyck, and Viv Li offer everyday people customized positive messages, audio creations, healing frequencies, binaural beats, and ASMR, responding to the needs of our community through a practice of radical sonic care. We promise our fullest intention

#### A fun, interactive questionnaire with popup links and play-on-click audio files encourages users to reflect on their relationship with sound and they are presented #### with an original "Audio Placebo" based on their answers. When users create an account they can save their Placebos and favourite sounds to return to any time!
